# Patients Interview Script
*Patients, while also stakeholders, differ from Users in that they will be using the platform at the suggestion of their therapists. They will have medium power and interest in the platform, a consequence of this self-help tool not being intended to replace traditional therapy or medical treatments, but rather to assist users in their daily tasks in between therapy sessions.*
