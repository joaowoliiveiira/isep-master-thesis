## **Background and Strategic Fit**

Youth mental health issues and disorders have been linked to the increased use of digital media platforms, particularly smartphone apps and video games. While traditional mental health support is essential, it is seldom utilized by young people, who often do not seek professional help. Therefore, it is important to provide tools that meet them where they are. Digital health interventions (DHIs) present a promising solution, but engagement rates with these interventions tend to be low.

Incorporating gamification into DHIs has the potential to enhance retention and engagement. However, it is crucial to carefully consider the ethical implications of how game elements are integrated into a mental health context. Consequently, many ethical aspects and design processes must be carefully taken into account during the design process of a mental health-related self-help DHI.

The current dissertation aims to explore the design and implementation process of one such platform while trying to provide relevant advancements to identified gamification research gaps.

- **Business / Product Goal**:  
  - Provide a mental health mobile app with gamification features.

- **Customer Research**:  
  - **Interview 1**: `[]`
