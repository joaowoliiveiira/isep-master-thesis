## Background and Strategic Fit

Young people often underutilize traditional mental health services despite increasing rates of emotional distress. To address this, digital health interventions (DHIs) can provide support, but must be designed to sustain engagement in a non-addictive way.

This app combines gamification and self-help principles to motivate habit formation and skill development, offering users a customized experience aligned with their personal growth.

## Product Goals

* Promote mental health and life skills through meaningful routines
* Gamify user progress with skill trees, avatars, and XP, as means to retain users and improve experience
* Provide flexible structure using personalized calendars
* Additionally offer guided tools (audio, text, etc.) for passive learning
